<p>I am an Associate Professor with the Department of Organizational Behavior at ICN Business School Paris, Nancy, Berlin, and a faculty member of the CEREFIGE research institute at Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France. I hold master's degrees in management from the Universite Paris Dauphine-PSL, France, and the Linne Universitet in Vaxjo, Sweden, and a Doctorate rer. pol. from the Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. </p>
<p>I do research on the organization of the State, questions of organizational design in general, and change issues. I have worked and published on topics such as organization theory, resistance to change, mindfulness, networks, high-reliability, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement in a variety of sectors and policy domains. This is a static, mobile-friendly webpage listing some of my current and past projects. </p>

<h3>Organizing cross-sector collaborations</h3>
<p>This project looks into cross-sector collaborations and determines the organizational processes required for participants to deliver sustainable change in the face of complex policy problems.</p>
<p>Related results can be found <a href="https://academic.oup.com/policyandsociety/article/39/4/638/6404007">here</a> and others were presented at the 2023 <a href="https://www.egos.org/2023_Cagliari/General-Theme">colloquium</a> of the European Group of Organization Studies.</p>

<h3>Risk and preparedness in cultural heritage institutions</h3>
<p>With the support of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldine</p>
<p>Accidents, fires, power outages or vandalism - cultural assets can be endangered or even destroyed by various events. This project attempts to create an overview of the perceived level of preparedness and local embeddedness of cultural managers.</p>
<p>A policy paper has been published and can be consulted <a href="https://www.leopoldina.org/publikationen/detailansicht/publication/organisatorische-voraussetzungen-der-notfallvorsorge-fuer-kulturgueter-2023/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Uncertainty and risks in the food industry</h3>
<p>Funded by the Dahlem Research School (17.716 EUR)</p>
<p>In 2011, an epidemic of food-borne illness spread across northern Germany. We have reconstructed the emergence of the response network created by public managers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03396912">here</a> <i>(selection of the best papers from the scientific commission on organization's 2013 program, VHB, Germany)</i>.</p>

We have also produced a small collection of case studies on failure-based innovation, which you can read <a href="https://www.artop.de/en/research/knowledge-tools/fields-of-research/failure-management/failure-driven-innovation/">here</a>.</p>
