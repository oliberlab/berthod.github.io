<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I am an Associate Professor at ICN Business School, France and Germany, and a member of the faculty at CEREFIGE, University of Lorraine, France. I do projects with businesses, public, and non profit organizations on behavior in and of organisations, change, collaboration, decision-making, communication and their impact on performance and effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<h3>The design of cross-sector partnerships for environmental action</h3>
<p>This project aims to determine the level of organization that partnerships need to achieve their goals in environmental conservation.</p>
<p>First results will be presented at the next <a href="https://www.egos.org/2023_Cagliari/General-Theme">colloquium of the European Group of Organization Studies</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Disaster preparedness of cultural heritage institutions</h3>
<p>Floods, fires, power outages or vandalism - cultural assets can be endangered or even destroyed by various events. This project attempts to create an overview of the needs for and methods of interorganizational and cross-sector emergency preparedness in practice.</p>
<p>Our policy paper recently came out, to be found <a href="https://www.leopoldina.org/publikationen/detailansicht/publication/organisatorische-voraussetzungen-der-notfallvorsorge-fuer-kulturgueter-2023/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
<h3>Improving communication in socio-paediatric care</h3>
<p>Funded by the Wagener Foundation (34.840EUR)</p>
<p>We provided evidence supporting the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7bJ1XUZjdnw#dialog">Michael Scott effect</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S186592172030101X">this paper</a> and found out that an attention to simpler wording does improve mutual understanding.</p>

<h3>Developing and running high-reliability networks</h3>
<p>Funded by the German Research Foundation (272.000EUR)</p>
<p>We showed how to improvise with scarce resources in the face of unforeseen events <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/padm.12660">here</a>, how decision-makers manage the expectations and sensitivites of their stakeholder network in between crises  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/27/2/352/2629304">in this one</a>, provided a framework to study distributed settings<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094428116633872?journalCode=orma"> there</a>, offered a definition of high-reliability networks <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-5973.12069">in this one</a> (a German translation can be found <a href="https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=PKTCDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA289&dq=info:UmG4HYQtqY0J:scholar.google.com&ots=FFKQJ2CObl&sig=MZEsUnNaa-n8fd--Mxze1Sl20qg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">here</a>) and showed why scenarios are less helpful than we thought and where to go from there in<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011392116640592?journalCode=csia"> this </a> and<a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBS-04-2017-0038/full/html"> this</a> papers.</p>

<h3>Uncertainty and risks in the food industry</h3>
<p>Funded by the Dahlem Research School (17.716EUR)</p>
<p>In 2011, a food-borne disease outbreak wrought havoc on the north of Germany. We reconstructed this emergent process of network response <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03396912">there</a>.</p>
<h3>Making sense of unexpected algorithmic responses</h3>
<p>Partly funded by the Peter Pribilla Foundation (50.000EUR)</p>
<p>We studied why airplane pilots can fail to make proper sense of unexpected algorithmic responses and crash and published this discussion <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1056492616686425?journalCode=jmia">there</a>. We also produced a small collection of case studies on failure-driven innovations, which you can find <a href="https://www.artop.de/en/research/knowledge-tools/fields-of-research/failure-management/failure-driven-innovation/">there</a>.</p>
<h3>Resistance to change and the management of World Heritage sites</h3>
<p>Funded by the German Research Foundation (PhD grant)</p>
<p>An in depth case study of decision makers torn between urban development and the preservation of a World Heritage site. Incidentally, two chapters related to this case were pubnlished <a href="hhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230392830_11">here</a> and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262519625/constructing-green/">there</a>.</p>
