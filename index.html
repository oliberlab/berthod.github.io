<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<h3>The design of cross-sector partnerships for environmental action</h3>
<p>This project aims to determine the level of organization that cross-sector partnerships need to achieve their goals in environmental conservation.</p>
<p>First results will be presented at the next <a href="https://www.egos.org/2023_Cagliari/General-Theme">colloquium</a> of the European Group of Organization Studies.</p>
<br>
<h3>Disaster preparedness of cultural heritage institutions</h3>
<p>Floods, fires, power outages or vandalism - cultural assets can be endangered or even destroyed by various events. This project attempts to create an overview of the needs for and methods of interorganizational and cross-sector emergency preparedness in practice.</p>
<p>Our policy paper recently came out, to be found <a href="https://www.leopoldina.org/publikationen/detailansicht/publication/organisatorische-voraussetzungen-der-notfallvorsorge-fuer-kulturgueter-2023/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
<h3>Improving communication in socio-paediatric care</h3>
<p>Funded by the Wagener Foundation (34.840 EUR)</p>
<p>We provided evidence supporting the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7bJ1XUZjdnw#dialog">Michael Scott effect</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S186592172030101X">this paper</a> and confirmed that attention to simpler wording does improve mutual understanding.</p>
<br>
<h3>Developing and running high-reliability networks</h3>
<p>Funded by the German Research Foundation (272.000 EUR)</p>
<p>We showed how to improvise with scarce resources in the face of unforeseen events <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/padm.12660">here</a>, how decision-makers manage the expectations and sensitivites of their stakeholder network between crises  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/27/2/352/2629304">in this paper</a>, provided a framework to study distributed settings<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094428116633872?journalCode=orma"> here</a>, offered a definition of high-reliability networks <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-5973.12069">in this article</a> (a German translation can be found <a href="https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=PKTCDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA289&dq=info:UmG4HYQtqY0J:scholar.google.com&ots=FFKQJ2CObl&sig=MZEsUnNaa-n8fd--Mxze1Sl20qg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">here</a>) and showed how to go beyond scenario planning in<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011392116640592?journalCode=csia"> this </a> and<a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBS-04-2017-0038/full/html"> this</a> papers.</p>

<h3>Uncertainty and risks in the food industry</h3>
<p>Funded by the Dahlem Research School (17.716 EUR)</p>
<p>In 2011, a food-borne disease outbreak spread over northern Germany. We reconstructed the emergence of the networked response created by public authorities <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03396912">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Failure-driven Innovations</h3>
<p>Partly funded by the Peter Pribilla Foundation (50.000 EUR)</p>
<p>We have studied why airplane pilots may not understand the unexpected algorithmic responses of their system and have published that discussion <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1056492616686425?journalCode=jmia">here</a>. We also produced a small collection of case studies on failure-driven innovations, which you can find <a href="https://www.artop.de/en/research/knowledge-tools/fields-of-research/failure-management/failure-driven-innovation/">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Resistance to change and the management of World Heritage sites</h3>
<p>Funded by the German Research Foundation (PhD grant)</p>
<p>An in-depth case study of decision-makers torn between urban development and preservation of a World Heritage Site. Two chapters on this case have been published <a href="hhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230392830_11">here</a> and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262519625/constructing-green/">here</a>.</p>
