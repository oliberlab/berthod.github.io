Hi! 
I am an associate professor of organizational behavior at ICN Business School, France and Germany, and a faculty member at CEREFIGE, University of Lorraine, France. 
I lead projects on issues of change, collaboration, decision making, communication and the impact of these issues on the performance and effectiveness of business, public and non-profit organizations.
This is a static page listing some of my research.
