Hi! 
I am an associate professor of organizational behavior at ICN Business School, France and Germany, and a faculty member at CEREFIGE, University of Lorraine, France. I do research on ways to improve organizational reliability and institutional decision-making in businesses, public sector and nonprofit organizations. This is a static page listing some of my research.
